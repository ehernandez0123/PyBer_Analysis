# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this new analysis is to be able to show through a multiple-line graph the total weekly fares for each city type.We are going to take a look at the average ride and total number of rides of three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. 

## Results
The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. As you can see in the imagine below urban cities has significantly more rides, driver and fares, but also, they had the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

## Summary
Knowing what we know based on the previous image and the image below, we can try to figure out a way to balance the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver in the rural and suburban cities to be able to gain more profit and/or meet a goal. 

Another improvement that could be made would be finding out what makes the total fare increase in the suburban and rural cities in the month of April. This could be very helpful in the future as we could be able to adjust the ride prices and be able to meet the profic goal for that month. 

Lastly, as stated before, urban cities have way more drivers than the suburban and rural cities together. It will be a great idea to place more drivers in the rural area to maximaze their profits as the fare per ride in rural areas is a bit more expensive than it is in the urban city.
